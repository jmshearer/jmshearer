# Welcome to my GitHub

While I've spen the last 25+ years developing software professionally, you'll likely find none of that here...it's all in private or organization repos.  Instead you'll mostly find a collection of random projects I've built for specific purposes and/or to have some fun with my kids.  I.e. don't judge!

If you're interested in some of my professional work:
- [About Me](http://jmshearer.com)
- [GTP Corporation](https://www.gtpcorp.com) (my day job)
- [SKUpics](https://www.skupics.com) (a company I helped launched and then sell)
- [Camp Swatara](http://www.campswatara.org) (one of my passions)

## A reminder when you look at my code...
